tite: Botulism Exposure


Are you familiar with botulism? Botulism is a food poison also know as Clostridium Botulinum. It is a toxin that can cause paralysis and death through respiratory failure. Now that there is some context behind botulism. I bet you are wondering what is the most common type and how many cases has there been over the years. Also, what are the ways to contract the toxin? Thanks to the CDC Botulism Consultation Service, Alaska Division of Public Health, and the California Department of non-infant botulism and infant botulism clinical data we can explore those questions. This data was collected over a 120 year study.
These clinical facilities were able to track confirmed cases. The confirmed cases consist of three different ways it can be contracted. As Fig.B1 shows below infants has a higher risk of being exposed to the toxin. It is more common for babies between 3 weeks and 6 months old to be affected by this illness. They are still at risk until 1 year of age. The Clostridium botulinum bacteria found in dirt and dust can contaminate honey. This is why it is cautioned against giving children under 1 honey. So parents, be mindful.
The next stop on this exposure train is food borne. This is also known as food poisoning. It can come from improper home canned or preserved foods. These include low acid vegetables and fermented fish. Exposure can also happen from commercially canned foods. Along with herb-infused oils, baking potatoes with aluminum foil, cheese sauce, and bottled garlic. Refer to fig.b2 for a deeper insight of the category of botulinum types and the exposure method.
